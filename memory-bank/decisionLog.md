* Rationale: Improves code clarity, enables better IDE support, helps LLM understanding
* Implementation: All classes and functions include type annotations

### Document-Based Architecture
* Decision: Use Document class as primary container for parts and history
* Rationale: Matches CAD industry standards, simplifies file I/O, enables history tracking
* Implementation: Document class manages parts list and operation history

### Parametric Modeling
* Decision: Implement parametric modeling through dedicated ParametricPart class
* Rationale: Separates concerns, allows for future expansion of constraint types
* Implementation: Basic constraint system with planned enhancements

## Implementation Details

### PyVista Integration Implementation Decisions
[2024-04-24 18:50:00] - Implementation completed

1. Mesh Validation:
   - Simplified validation to check only for points and cells
   - Removed strict triangulation requirements from validation
   - Reason: PyVista's built-in validators were too strict for basic operations

2. Geometry Conversion:
   - Added optional parameters in constructors for PyVista conversion
   - Implemented from_pyvista class methods for both Box and Cylinder
   - Added automatic triangulation in _create_mesh methods
   - Reason: Ensures clean conversion between internal and PyVista representations

3. Boolean Operations:
   - Added triangulation at multiple points:
     * Input meshes are triangulated before operations
     * Result mesh is triangulated after operations
   - Centralized operations in boolean_operation function
   - Added proper error handling and mesh validation
   - Reason: Ensures robust boolean operations with proper mesh quality

4. Test Coverage:
   - Added comprehensive tests for geometry creation
   - Added tests for transformations
   - Added tests for boolean operations
   - Added tests for error conditions
   - Tests verify both success cases and error handling

Next Phase:
   - Implement STEP/STL format support
   - Enhance visualization capabilities
   - Optimize performance for complex operations

### STL Export Implementation
[2024-04-24 19:59:00] - Implemented STL export

* Decision: Use PyVista's `save()` method with a temporary file.
* Rationale: Direct writing to `BytesIO` is not supported by `pyvista.save()`. Using a temporary file provides a reliable way to capture the binary STL data.
* Implementation:
  - Create a `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with `.stl` suffix.
  - Save the combined mesh to the temporary file using `combined.save(temp_filename, binary=True)`.
  - Read the binary data from the temporary file.
  - Ensure the temporary file is deleted using a `finally` block.

### Implementation Plan for PyVista Integration
[2024-04-24 18:35:00] - Defined implementation sequence

#### Phase 1: Setup and Conversion
1. Add PyVista dependency
2. Create geometry conversion methods:
   - Box to PyVista mesh
   - Cylinder to PyVista mesh
   - PyVista mesh to internal geometry
3. Add tests for conversions

#### Phase 2: Validation
1. Implement mesh validation:
   - Triangle mesh verification
   - Manifold checking
   - Water-tight validation
2. Add validation tests
3. Add error handling for invalid meshes

#### Phase 3: Boolean Operations
1. Implement union operation
2. Implement difference operation

### Pending Decisions
* Visualization System Architecture
* Advanced Constraint Solver Implementation
* Performance Optimization Strategy
* File Format Library Selection

[2025-04-24 20:39:43] - STEP Export Implementation

Decision:
* Implemented STEP file export using Python's standard library for file handling
* Structured exported data following ISO 10303 STEP file format

Rationale:
* STEP format (ISO 10303) is an industry standard for CAD data exchange
* Native Python implementation ensures minimal dependencies
* Standardized format enables interoperability with other CAD systems

Implementation Details:
* File extension: .stp
* Implemented header section with file metadata
* Structured data section containing geometric entities
* Unit testing validates file structure and content

[2025-04-24 21:00:00] - STEP Export Dependency Re-evaluation

* Issue: `pythonocc-core` dependency identified as potentially requiring Conda, conflicting with pip-based `requirements.txt`.
* Research: Confirmed `pythonocc-core` is best installed via Conda (`conda-forge`). Pure-pip alternatives for *generating* STEP files are limited/non-existent.
* Decision: Maintain `pythonocc-core` for STEP export but make it an *optional* dependency. Provide a mock implementation when it's not installed. Document Conda installation clearly.
* Rationale: Provides full STEP capability for users who can use Conda, while offering basic functionality/testing path for others.

[2025-04-24 21:33:00] - Dependency Management Standardization

* Decision: Switch project entirely to Conda for dependency management. Remove `requirements.txt` and use `environment.yml` exclusively.
* Rationale: Simplifies environment setup, avoids pip/conda conflicts, standardizes on the environment needed for the mandatory `pythonocc-core` dependency (required for STEP export as per user request).
* Implementation: Created `environment.yml` with all dependencies (`python`, `numpy`, `pyvista`, `pythonocc-core`) sourced from `conda-forge`. Marked `requirements.txt` for deletion.

## Decision [2025-04-24 21:53]
Modularize cad_system.py into a package structure

### Rationale
- Improve code organization and maintainability
- Separate concerns into logical modules
- Enable better testing and component isolation
- Facilitate future extensions

### Implementation Strategy
Split into three main packages:
- core/: Core system functionality and base classes
- part/: Part-related functionality and operations
- document/: Document management and file operations

### Implementation Details
1. Create package structure with __init__.py files
2. Migrate existing code into appropriate modules
3. Update imports and dependencies
4. Ensure backward compatibility during transition
