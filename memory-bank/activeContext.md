# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

[2024-04-24 18:25:00] - Initial active context established.
[2024-04-24 18:28:00] - Updated focus to Boolean operations implementation.

## Current Focus
* Finalizing dependency management switch to Conda.
* Ensuring STEP export works correctly with mandatory pythonocc-core.

## Recent Changes
* Initial project setup complete
* Core classes implemented (CADSystem, Document, Part, Box, Cylinder)
* Basic unit tests in place
* Memory Bank initialized
* PyVista integration for Boolean operations completed.
* STL export implemented.
* STEP export implemented (initially optional OCC, then refactored to mandatory OCC).
* Decision made to standardize on Conda for dependency management.
* `environment.yml` created.
* Memory Bank updated to reflect Conda standardization.

## Open Questions/Issues
1. Visualization
   - Should we implement a basic viewer or integrate with existing tools?
   - What visualization library would best suit our needs?

2. Performance Considerations
   - When should we implement spatial indexing?
   - How to optimize constraint solving for complex parametric models?

3. Environment Setup
   - User needs to confirm environment setup using `environment.yml` and test execution.

[2025-04-24 20:39:43] - Recent Changes
* STEP export functionality completed and tested
* Unit tests passing for STEP file generation

Current Focus:
* System now supports basic CAD file export capability
* Ready for integration with broader CAD workflows

[2025-04-24 21:33:00] - Recent Changes
* Standardized on Conda for dependency management.
* Created `environment.yml`.
* Marked `requirements.txt` as obsolete.

Current Focus:
* Removing `requirements.txt`.
* Committing Conda standardization changes.
