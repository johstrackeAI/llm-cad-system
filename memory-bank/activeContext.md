# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

[2024-04-24 18:25:00] - Initial active context established.
[2024-04-24 18:28:00] - Updated focus to Boolean operations implementation.

## Current Focus
* Boolean Operations Implementation
  - Research geometric computation libraries
  - Select appropriate library for geometric operations
  - Plan implementation strategy for union, difference, and intersection
  - Design test suite for Boolean operations
* Key areas needing immediate attention:
  - Boolean operations (currently stubs)
  - File I/O for STEP/STL formats
  - Parametric constraint solver enhancement
  - Visualization system implementation

## Recent Changes
* Initial project setup complete
* Core classes implemented:
  - CADSystem
  - Document
  - Part
  - Basic geometry (Box, Cylinder)
* Basic unit tests in place
* Memory Bank initialized for project tracking

## Open Questions/Issues
1. Geometric Computation Engine
   - What geometric computation library should we use for Boolean operations?
   - How to handle complex 3D operations efficiently?

2. File Format Support
   - Priority order for implementing STEP/STL/OBJ/DXF support?
   - Which libraries to use for each format?

3. Visualization
   - Should we implement a basic viewer or integrate with existing tools?
   - What visualization library would best suit our needs?

4. Performance Considerations
   - When should we implement spatial indexing?
   - How to optimize constraint solving for complex parametric models?

[2025-04-24 20:39:43] - Recent Changes
* STEP export functionality completed and tested
* Unit tests passing for STEP file generation

Current Focus:
* System now supports basic CAD file export capability
* Ready for integration with broader CAD workflows
