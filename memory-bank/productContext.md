This file provides a high-level overview of the project and the expected product based on available documentation and code analysis.

[2024-04-24 18:25:00] - Initial project context established.

## Project Goal
* Create an LLM-friendly CAD system with a clean, programmatic interface
* Focus on predictability, explicit state management, and robust error handling
* Enable automation and integration with AI/LLM systems

## Key Features
* Core CAD Operations
  - Basic geometry primitives (Box, Cylinder)
  - Boolean operations (Union, Difference, Intersection)
  - Transformations (Translation, Rotation)
  - Parametric modeling support

* API Design
  - Clean Python interface with type hints
  - Immutable operations
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - State management through Document class

* Document Management
  - File I/O (JSON primary, STEP/STL/OBJ/DXF planned)
  - History tracking with undo/redo support
  - Part management and retrieval

## Overall Architecture
* System Components:
  - CADSystem: Main entry point and document management
  - Document: Container for parts and history
  - Part: Core modeling primitive with parameters
  - Geometry: Abstract base for geometric implementations
  - ParametricPart: Constraint-based modeling support

* Implementation Status:
  - Core structure implemented
  - Basic geometry working
  - Boolean operations stubbed
  - Basic test coverage in place
  - File I/O partially implemented (JSON primary)

## Development Timeline
* Based on implementation roadmap:
  - Phase 1: Core Foundation (In Progress)
  - Phase 2: Advanced Features (Pending)
  - Phase 3: LLM Integration (Pending)
  - Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Pending)
